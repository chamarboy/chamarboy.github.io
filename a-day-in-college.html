                <h1>Some time in 2001</h1>
<h2><em>You people have nothing to worry about, you'll get jobs easily. The problem is for people like us</em></h2>
<p>Ankur quipped while we are discussing the prospects of getting job after college. Being a back bencher and flunking in numerous examinations, I do not know how to respond to this unexpected attack. We are bunking some class, sitting outside a food joint. I am holding Anusha's hand, she might have felt my hand twitch.</p>
<p>After a long silence, considering the path of least resistance, i decided to change the topic.</p>
<p><em>The job market is difficult after the recession. All of us have some hard time ahead of us</em></p>
<p>But the Jack ma look alike had to make make his point.</p>
<h2><em>Why do you why people like you would look into the private job market? There's so many of amazing opportunities available in the government sector. And believe me, you will earn far more than the private sector</em></h2>
<p><em>It's not for everyone to see things your way.</em></p>
<p>I think that ended the discussion.</p>
<p>I looked at Anusha as she is looking into my eyes. She is asking me to ignore this, but I cant seem to decide. We decide to go back to college.</p>
<p>We were happy gang of 15 middle class misfits, who who liked each other some of them had romantic inclinations. Some things have changed. Now we are 7.</p>
<p>Anusha is like a friend I never deserved or worked for. Of all the people in my life, I think she is the only one who feels what I am going through. I have never shared details of the legal and moral issues I am facing at home, but she only knows about Gunjan, and how I am still deeply in love with a with her.</p>
<p>I feel i am selfishly using her. I have no prospects, a loser to the core, still she prefers me. Even I dont prefer myself these days. She still does.</p>
<p>Gunjan....I dont know if she will be back or she has gone for good. I cant stop thinking about her. Maybe she is dating a stud she deserves...maybe she is being tricked by one of the thousand bastards who seem to be following her day and night. Anyways, I dont seem to deserve her. She has a good idea or some good info on me being an undeserving chamar who tricked her into accepting my proposal.....good that nothing happened....this guilt of tricking her would have killed me.</p>
<p>Here is Anusha, the best of girls I would ever meet....holding my hand despite knowing my reality. I can feel love when she holds my hand.</p>
<p>And I don't know how it happened. I don't even remember the first time I held her hand, it seemed to have happened naturally.
As far as i can remember, she was talking me about a guy she seemed to have been dating, and it did not end well...i understood....and maybe that is how we became friends.</p>
<p>Much of the things between us seemed to be unsaid. She will wait for me, I would wait for her....find any simple excuse to be with her.....go on long walks....bunk classes to be with her. She did not seem to mind sitting on my old scooter.</p>
<p>She somehow understood....and I could feel her....her hands told me all i needed to know....some weird telepathy shit....or i am delusional.</p>
<p>I know what hurts her, I know when I hurt her, and how could I make it alright. She never hurt me.....and when she did....</p>
<p>Come back to the present moment...
This awkward argument means Jack Maa is targeting me now, after  kicking Ashish out of the initial group of 15. Everyone in this leftover group of 7 is a bloody beta, all ugly or short....basically un dateable set of severely undeserving poor specimen of the male form. No one Anusha would ever consider.</p>
