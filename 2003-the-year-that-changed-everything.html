                <p>26 Sept 2003</p>
<p>I think i passed engineering. Not happy but relieved.</p>
<p>I am oscillating between a deep sense of regret of not doing the things
I wanted to do in engineering and the relief that I survived despite all
odds.</p>
<p>As part of the first batch of engineering from this college, there are
not many prospects to start with. Though I am trying for jobs, my heart
knows that i will not get any - grades and the way I looked - deformed
bald and itchy.</p>
<p>I am trying to prepare for GATE, to finally do the nerdy stuff which i
am very capable of doing. 4 years of engineering taught me a valuable
lesson - people are highly ordinary - not capable of creating anything
new, just masters of mugging and following the orders.</p>
<p>The legal storm caused by my sisters adventures finally seems to be
over, my father seems to have it handled. I never disclosed it to
anyone, but I am prepared to do <em>anything</em> if the situation goes worse.
Every night I evaluate the strategy, the tools and the things I need to
be careful about. This decision is a combined result of my current
state, my duties as a brother and my complete belief that life would not
be any different from what I have experienced it till now. Life in
prison sounded way real and acceptable than spending years with the
scared yet competitive sheep of engineering college graduates.</p>
<p>My mom and father love each other. I cant make sense of it. My father is
a principled, hard working individual, though my mother is really
nothing but manipulative, power hungry, ugly excuse of a female. It is
not like only I hated her, all of us did, except my father.</p>
<p>At least once a month, my mother and father would take off to a <em>date</em>
of sorts - they would leave in morning and come back late at night. This
has been one of the happiest days of the month for me and my sisters for
years.</p>
<p>Off late, I have distanced myself from my second sister. I like being
alone and destructive, a man who has no one and nothing to loose. The
people around me are too busy to cater to their plans to take over the
world, who would care about a discolored, bottom of the class chamar
boy? Hey, my answer is the same as you, hence the going out in brotherly
glory plan.</p>
<p>I am happy at the prospect of never going back to the college again,
forced to communicate with those judgmental pricks of classmates,
teachers who would congratulate me and suggest that i would get a fat
<em>sarkari</em> job now. Somehow Infy, TCS, Polaris etc are never discussed
with me.</p>
<p>Mom and Dad left for their monthly date, sister is out doing whatever
she does. I am up, go to the computer room and dial up the Internet.
Checking mail, yeah....no prospects, the self destruct plan stands.
Phone rings.</p>
<p>I hate phone....she never calls, and she wont. She knows now, at-least
suspects it...me being a chamaar. How can the shiniest, most popular
girl date a chamar? Anyways, I will explain the situation later.</p>
<p>I answer, the digits seem similar - the call is from our family cell
phone. I pick up, though i do not recognize the voice. The voice is of
my uncle, he is trying to tell me something important in a very non
important way. The car has broken down, and i need to come to get it
fixed. I should get a friend to drive my bike back so I could drive the
car after getting it repaired. The location is near a hospital. I say
yes, and did not argue how illogical the plan sounded. In the background
i could hear a lot of commotion. Anyways, i needed to patch up my
appearance and drive a bike with no rear brakes for 100 kms. When you
are on a death wish, these choices are really not a choice.</p>
<p>I call up a friend, a fellow SC/ST boy who flunked and now is a junior.
Caste seems to be the only quality which defines my life right now. I am
afraid of the general friends - ex girl friend might have blabbered..the
news might have spread....and i have lost my looks. Most of people avoid
me in college, the friends i thought i had left me because a girl who
seems to have loved me, told everyone that i molested her. I never did.
I literally and figuratively had lost my face and most friends with it.</p>
<p>SC friend shows up. He is riding pillion and i am driving my Bajaj
caliber chroma. My friend is asking a lot of questions, i don't have any
answers.</p>
<p>I drive, having some non-sense chatter with friend. My mind is racing
though. Maybe my grandmother is sick or died and maybe my dad is too
broken up to drive. This seemed to be the most logical interpretations
of the facts i could recall.</p>
<p>After an hours drive, we arrive at a hospital. As i enter, I could see
100s of faces I had forgotten. They seemed to be all watching me
closely. I am not sure if its due to my current appearance or due to the
incident.</p>
<p>Something is amiss. The damn car seems fine. People are crying, I am
trying to find someone talk-able. Someone directs me to a sub group.
Mother is crying, trying to be sad than she is.</p>
<p>Father is dead.</p>
<p>How, why and what the fuck? Did her stupidity killed him or was it an
assault? I am enraged, hoping it was an assault....and i get to kill
someone for it...finally justify my existence. It was a heart attack.</p>
<p>I don't understand...are they sure? This is a good private
hospital...they must be sure. I could have reacted way more naturally
had I was not surrounded by literally 100s of people. Indians love
drama, and i was customary bound to provide it today.</p>
<p>Something has hardened me enough to disobey conventions, and to realize
what it means.....I am no longer the kid brother, or someone who can ask
for help. With my stupid mom and uncontrollable sister.....what the
literal fuck?? I need help to come to terms of what is happening to me
and now this added responsibility too?</p>
<p>Nothing is fair. As my brain is processing the implications, I am
interrupted - there are choices to be made. Where to do the <em>kriyas</em>? I
don't know. I am thinking here. I have my uncles, and I do not know what
is to be done. My mother interferes. She turns off her crying for a
moment and tells me to tell them Rohini, at our new home. I want to
protest, but then a dollop of emotional superiority infused cold logic
shrewd logic is disclosed....we need to keep up the reputation. I just
want to be alone, as soon as possible. I say yes. Handing over the keys
of the bike to the friend i tell him to be careful, the rear brakes are
not working, the front ones do, but they are more effective than one
anticipates.</p>
<p>Life would never be the same again.</p>
