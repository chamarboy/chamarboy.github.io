<p>I think i passed engineering. Not happy but relieved. 
 I am oscillating between a deep sense of regret of not doing the things I wanted to do in engineering and the relief that I survived despite all odds.</p>
<p>As part of the first batch of engineering from this college, there are not many prospects to start with. Though I am trying for jobs, my heart knows that i will not get any - grades and the way I looked - deformed bald and itchy.</p>
<p>I am trying to prepare for GATE, to finally do the nerdy stuff which i am very capable of doing. 4 years of engineering taught me a valuable lesson - people are highly ordinary - not capable of creating anything new, just masters of mugging and following the orders.</p>
<p>The legal storm caused by my sisters adventures finally seems to be over, my father seems to have it handled. I never disclosed it to anyone, but I am prepared to do <strong>anything</strong> had the situation gone any bad. Every night I  evaluate the strategy, the tools and the things I need to be careful about. This decision is a combined result of my current state, my duties as a brother and my complete belief that life would not be any different from what I had experienced in college. Life in prison sounded way real and acceptable than spending years with the scared yet competitive sheep of engineering college graduates.</p>
<p>My mom and father love each other. I cant make sense of it. My father is a principled hard working individual, though my mother is really nothing but manipulative, power hungry, ugly excuse of a female. It is not like only I hated her, all of us did, except my father.</p>
<p>At least once a month, my mother and father would take off to a <em>date</em> of sorts - they would leave in morning and come back late at night. This has been one of the happiest days of the month for me and my sisters for years.</p>
<p>Off late, I have distanced myself from my second sister. I like being alone and destructive, a man who has no one and nothing to loose. The people around me are too busy to cater to their plans to take over the world, who would care about a discolored, bottom of the class chamar boy? Hey, my answer is the same as you, hence the going out in brotherly glory plan.</p>
<p>I am happy at the prospect of never going back to the college again, forced to communicate with those judgmental pricks of classmates, teachers who would congratulate me and suggest that i would get a fat sarkari job now. Somehow Infy and TCS etc were never discussed with me.</p>
