                <h1>Who</h1>
<p>I am a Chamar boy, born in a somewhat normal middle class (not Chamar
middle class, normal middle class) family.</p>
<p>I was born in 1981 in a semi-urban village in Delhi.</p>
<p>My father had a Bajaj Super in 1990, and we got a landline telephone in
1997.</p>
<p>I know it's hard to imagine a village in Delhi now, but in 1990 till the
time we stayed there, it had a water well, we had cows and cow dung was
the primary fuel though my father got us LPG ever since i can remember.</p>
<p>So now here we are. Year is 2020, the most chaotic year for my
generation, but somehow I am better placed than I ever was.</p>
<p>I have a spacious (in most senses) house, 2 cars, 2 dogs, a beautiful
and intelligent son and mostly loving wife.</p>
<p>And I work at Facebook.</p>
<p>That is the big reveal. 2 Cr.</p>
<p>That declaration is not an achievement, I just want my readers to know
what they are dealing with here.</p>
<p>This Facebook and the money thing seems important to society.</p>
<p>Apparently it kind of justifies my existence. People are nicer.</p>
<p>Hypocrisy of society becomes very apparent when you are even minutely
successful.</p>
<p>Ever since I have realized what Chamar is, and how apparently we have
special powers given by the constitution, a subject of envy and
inflammatory debates on social media and hushed discussion in social
circles.</p>
<h1>Why</h1>
<p>As I am getting older, I do tend to think about the past, mostly to
learn from it. I remember those days, when my self worth was negative
million.</p>
<p>I was targeted, gaslit at college, did not take it well, slipped in a
depression, developed Psoriasis, spent years in a sham ayurvedic ashram
with skin swollen like a balloon filled with pus covered in cow dung.</p>
<p>Abandonment by the girl I loved, the girl who loved me, friends, my own
family. A failed suicide attempt, living through vengeance, death of
father, a sister which destroyed the family, destroyed my existence.</p>
<p>All because I am a Chamar.</p>
<p>It was not all bad, It somehow made me realize the strengths which I
thought I never had, and did generally well. Something kept me pushing,
and I kept breathing.</p>
<p>I want to share my journey with you. Anyone who feels like I did in my
Chamar years can get some semblance of hope or direction and hopefully
he/she does not commit the grave mistakes I did, or felt like how I
felt.</p>
<h2>To Readers</h2>
<p>I hope you get a balanced view of a Chamar life and hopefully next time
you feel like feeling taller, maybe you will be empathetic to the SC/ST
humanoid in your class, office or school.</p>
<p>If you feel like saying stuff, you have the full freedom to give me a
piece of your mind, absolutely brutally.</p>
<p>I have will update the blog in a way that anonymous are welcome and give
me their best shot. It's sort of a fuel to me now.</p>
<h2>To my fellow Chamaar/SC/ST Readers</h2>
<p>I hope you learn.</p>
<p>I hope you feel hopeful.</p>
<p>I hope you can believe in yourself, rather than what society is telling
you silently.</p>
<p>If my journey can benefit any one of you, my efforts would make sense to
me.</p>
<h1>How</h1>
<p>I will try to narrate it in a novel kind of style.</p>
<p>You already know where I am.</p>
<p>Logically my story starts in class 11, when I started realizing the
implications of being a chamar, what it meant for career, for making
friends, girls and neighborhood.</p>
<p>I have changed certain key details, to preserve the identity of the
people involved.</p>
<p>I will narrate the journey, leaving the judgment to readers.</p>
