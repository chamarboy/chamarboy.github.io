</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>I am a chamar boy, born in a somewhat normal middle class (not chamar middle class, normal middle class) family</p>
<p>My father had a Bajaj super in 1990, and we got a telephone in 1997.
I was born in 1982 in a semi-urban village in Delhi. </p>
<p>I know its hard to imagine a 'village" in Delhi now, but in 1990 till the time we stayed there, it had a well, we had cows and cow dung was the primary fuel though my father got us LPG ever since i can remember.</p>
<p>So now here we are. Year is 2020, chaos year of my generation, but somehow i am better placed then i ever was. </p>
<p>I have a spacious (in most senses) house, 2 cars, 2 dogs, a beautiful and intelligent son and mostly loving wife.</p>
<p>And I work at Facebook.</p>
<p>That is the big reveal. 2cr. I want to share my journey with you, so anyone who feels like i did in my chamar years can get some semblance of hope or direction.</p>
<p>This Facebook thing is important to me atleast as ever since i have realized what chamar is, and how apparently things have being laid out for us - in sarkari sphere. </p>
<p>It is a deal with devil and living a life where you never knew what your worth was or taking a chance on yourself.</p>
<p>I hope you get a balanced view of a chamar life and hopefully give me a piece of your mind, absolutely brutally. I have designed the blog in a way that anonymous are welcome and give me their best shot. You have powered me, and would continue to provide me more ammo to succeed.
And to my fellow chamaar/sc/st boys and gals....I hope you benefit. I hope if my journey can benefit any 1 of you, my efforts would make sense to me.</p>
