                <ul>
<li>No more&nbsp;Maths!!</li>
<li>I am in love with my dream girl Gunjan, and she seems to love me&nbsp;too</li>
<li>Got into a prestigious engineering college, that too on a <em>free&nbsp;seat</em></li>
<li>Mom and Dad seem to be&nbsp;proud.</li>
<li>I have loyal friends who are fun and inspiring&nbsp;too</li>
<li>Sisters are happy in their own&nbsp;worlds</li>
</ul>
<p>After six months of anxiety, Everything seems to be going my way. World
is a fair place, life is&nbsp;fair.</p>
<p>Then why is my spidey sense tingling ? I should be happy, content and
optimistic&#8230;..but the tingling is growing bigger, unavoidable ,
something that demands&nbsp;urgency.</p>
<p>As I am thinking, the pessimistic chamar boy inside me gets another
opportunity to tell me to recall the lessons imparted by my father. The
mini horror stories which my father seems to hide, or sometimes he would
try to share a varnished version of his rough experiences being chamar
boy&nbsp;senior.</p>
<p>His stories were often re-runs, though his narration and emotions would
change each time he recounted his&nbsp;experiences.</p>
<p>I tried to listen, though my sisters seemed to phase them out. I think
being older they have listened to these stories more than me, and now
they know the story but cant seem to relate the message to current&nbsp;circumstances.</p>
<p>A father walks a difficult path, whether to fill his kids with optimism,
or to warn them about how fucked up the real world is. How men turn into
farm animals – just give them privacy and some leverage over the other&nbsp;person.</p>
<p>This is what i have gotten to know so far from my father and his choice
of composition of his re run&nbsp;stories.</p>
<p>For last 2 years, things have been bitter in the house. Ever since my
elder sister ran off to marry a brahmin boy, my father seems to have
taken a rather pessimistic view of life. His sentences indicate
dejection, sound impersonal and formal. It seemed like his faith in his
kids has been lost. Every tone sounds defensive, as if he is trying to
distance us from the decisions we may take. He became a very formal
father. There may have an attempt to acknowledge me as an adult member
of the house, which translated to more duties and expectations without
any chance of&nbsp;failure.</p>
<p>There may have been some resentment from my side too&#8230;.considering i
have been physically and publicly beaten by my father on a few
occasions. Last incident was just few months&nbsp;back.</p>
<p><em>I will finally get a computer!!! </em>That is the gain i have focused my
attention on. I have earned&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>Gunjan seems happy, we talk everyday at night&#8230;the telephone bills have
been noticed, so i call her from a public phone-booth owner by a creepy
guy. Rs 1 for 3 minutes of awkward silences, random talk. I do get
probed for lost time and begging for more pocket-money is a weekly
ritual&#8230;.just to hear her&nbsp;voice.</p>
<p>Gunjan and I share a something spiritual&#8230; a level of emotional
intimacy that is hard to describe. I know she is damaged, misunderstood,
happy, having a very desirable female form which attracts all kinds of&nbsp;attention.</p>
<p>I have not told her about my feelings for her, and she makes extra
efforts to make me feel like another extra in her life&#8230;.she likes me,
waits for my call, gives me attention, tries to keep tabs on me
too&#8230;but the beauty of it all has been &#8230;.i always felt insecure&#8230;her
words express indifference though her tone is always enticing&#8230;.a
riddle that i can never&nbsp;solve.</p>
<p>Elder sister visits, though her visits are very&nbsp;stressful.</p>
<p>Younger sister is not doing well though. I never identified with
her&#8230;her values, her approach to problem analysis and solutions has
been highly circumspect. Ever since my elder sister eloped, we look out
for each other, though I do not understand her choices. She is my new
support system. She is struggling with studies, personal relationships
though she seems to be happy and&nbsp;optimistic.</p>
<p>My mother has become more viscous. She seems to be always on lookout for
anything remotely suspicious. Our college timings, friends&#8230;.everything
was her area of attention and instant&nbsp;judgment.</p>
<p>Most nights, my father and mother would drink up senseless. Me and my
sister were assigned the ground floor, mother and father used to occupy
first floor. At ten, we would depart to our respective rooms. In my
estimate, my father and mother consume 3-4 pegs of whiskey along with a
beer each before losing the sense of loudness and&nbsp;awareness.</p>
<p>I could hear her inciting my father everyday on either of these few&nbsp;issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>how their own daughter betrayed&nbsp;them</li>
<li>how their siblings have betrayed&nbsp;them</li>
<li>how my sister and i are following in our elder sisters&nbsp;footsteps.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some nights, my mother would cover a few issues and on really bad ones,
they would cover all, get drunker than usual and call despicable names
for all &#8230;. including&nbsp;us.</p>
<p>My nights were simple - trying to call Gunjan at nights, be on guard if
things go&nbsp;bad.</p>
<p>The really bad nights were the one where my mother would succeed in
finding something which was remotely true&#8230;.and my sister’s struggle in
her life would give her periodic ammunition. Special night horror show
used to start with our parents discussing about my sister or me, in an
extremely loud, obnoxiously oblivious way&#8230;as if they deliberately want
us to hear their messaging, giving them benefit of doubt of being drunk.
After 25-40 minutes of this intentional yet unintentional drama, my
father would call out for <strong>both</strong> of us. These edge of seat, awaiting
the dreaded call-out moments kept me anxious to say the least. I have to
keep listening, to be ready to defend us, if and when we would be called
out to <em>discuss</em> issues in my chamaar family&nbsp;style.</p>
<p>My father has 2 very noticeable&nbsp;flaws</p>
<ol>
<li>He is and has been afraid of&nbsp;conflict.</li>
<li>His judgment seems to be influence-able, proven by the fact that my
    illogical, viscous mom had succeeded in isolating him from the world
    he nurtured – our village where we were genuinely cared for. His own
    kids seem like a liability to him&nbsp;now</li>
</ol>
<p>My uncles -father’s brothers have been the best tutors to nurture us as
kids, we being the initial ones in our unusually big joint family. Our
extended family was respected and feared at the same time. My granddad
had a larger than life image – his tool was his aggression, flamboyance
and the original devil may care&nbsp;attitude.</p>
<p>My father and uncles were an exact mirror opposite image of my
grandfather. Logical, careful, painfully aware of their status in
society’s pecking order. All of them made out of the same material as my
grandmother – a genuine diplomat with extremely caring personality –
perfectly complementary characteristics to my grandfather. My time spend
in this environment has been the most happiest, blissful period of my
life. This deserves a separate post&nbsp;later.</p>
<p>Coming back to spidey sense&#8230;.it has been tingling ever since my elder
sister has eloped, every night has been a torture, a reminder of how i
need to run away from home as soon as i start earning. I have a whole
plan – i would move to a different city, elope with Gunjan and live
happily ever after and telling about my truth in the deathbed. She is
everything i need!! and sometimes she helps me distance from my fucked
up nights. Though I cannot afford love in current circumstances, I need
her…she is the only normal thing in my teenage life, my only sense of
intimacy of thought&#8230;a sense of belonging,&nbsp;loving.</p>
<p>It is 10, and horror show resumes : <span class="caps">S03E234</span>.</p>
<p>I have the luxury of space – I have taken the living room at ground
floor as my room. The room is directly above our functional living room,
where my mom and dad <em>discuss</em> their daily challenges and defeats. I can
hear when they move their glasses or go to the balcony. I try to not be
in this room when these drunken conversations are happening. Cannot call
Gunjan right now, I might be called in anytime upstairs, then I would
have to explain her about the abrupt phone hangup. Also her phone is
rarely available from 10-11, I prefer to call her after my parents
conclude their night&nbsp;party.</p>
<p>ChamarBoy, come upstairs….we need to discuss&nbsp;something.</p>
<p>The dreaded call has come. Why now, why today&#8230;my mind is racing. My
sister is also called. I get out&#8230;i can see my sister standing in the
hallway too. This time the issue seems to be about her
academics&#8230;though my father thinks of these meetings as a bonus to
teach&nbsp;me.</p>
<p>We try to get out of it, by making feeble excuses, but I am not sure if
those were heard. We have become somewhat used to this routine. We are
smiling outside with our minds&nbsp;racing.</p>
<p>The stairs are dark, sister (lets call her rani delusional) lits up the
dreaded U shape stairway. We start walking. As we reach in the middle to
take the U step, mom unbolts the 1<sup>st</sup> floor entry&nbsp;gate.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Sab sach batana warna ghar se nikal denge tere papa….tumhe humari
life mein problem create karne ke alawa aata hi kya&nbsp;hai……</p>
<p>..</p>
<p>…”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mom’s background abuses are faded away as we enter the living room. The
smell and the moment remind of your place in this&nbsp;house.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shaadi karni hai ya&nbsp;padhai?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I looked up – It is not a question you may ask your 17 year son. I am
not sure if he asked me or my&nbsp;sister?</p>
<p>He was looking at&nbsp;me.</p>
<p>5 seconds pass, it cant be that obvious ? Can it&nbsp;be?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“padhai”</p>
<p>“Toh padhta kyun nahin&nbsp;hai?”</p>
<p>“papa mein padh raha&nbsp;hoon”</p>
<p>“Tera admission kitni pareshani ke baad hua hai, bhagte bhoot ki
langoti pakdi hai tune, kabhi pura kaam bhi kar liya&nbsp;kar”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He has a point there – I cant seem to get anything completed. I do the
bare minimum and take my chances. Too much life is happening around me.
Gunjan takes away most of my time and&nbsp;attention.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Papa, I am doing well now</em> (I really am&nbsp;not)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After a couple of more awkward questions, we are signaled to leave. It
is 12 now, new day has&nbsp;started.</p>
<p>Is Gunjan&nbsp;up??</p>
<p>I hurry to my room and hookup a stolen/borrowed landline phone into the
telephone sockets which I have secretly extended to my room. This is a
lineman’s phone – big yellow with rotary dial. One of my friends had
gifted this phone to me – I think he stole it when lineman was up in the
pole and left his work bag on ground. What a genuine&nbsp;buddy!!</p>
<p>It is ringing………..no response…&#8230;is she angry?? Is she done with me??
Has she found someone better ( everyone is better!!)??….maybe she wants
me to feel disposable….she is a weird girl&#8230;i think she sabotages
things..when they become&nbsp;real…</p>
<p>No response. I decide not to try again….she might be sleeping or she is
ignoring me&#8230;either ways I cant seem to&nbsp;sleep.</p>
<p>Things with Gunjan have been complicated to say the least. A loser
general boy who couldn&#8217;t not even clear <span class="caps">BBA</span> exams told her that I belong
to <span class="caps">SC</span>/<span class="caps">ST</span> category, hence I am able to clear the entrance exams. This is
not a false statement&#8230;it was my truth to tell….i wanted to tell her
when I was&nbsp;ready.</p>
<p>It devoids me of the privilege of telling my truth personally, and I
would have told her when I was sure of my worthiness. Yes I have been
lying to her….self preservation reasons mainly. A prom queen cannot be
seen with a chamar boy….that much was clear to&nbsp;me.</p>
<p>I could see her slipping away&#8230;she has been acting aloof&#8230;even by her
hot girl&nbsp;persona.</p>
<p>Love or even creating a possibility of love is an expensive proposition
for anyone at my standards. Even I ignore the substantial emotional
baggage and guilt I have been carrying….my world was built on a false
identity….all of which may collapse once my truth is&nbsp;out.</p>
<p>And there are college studies too&#8230;12 exams in a curtailed
1<sup>st</sup> semester in 4 months including my demon -&nbsp;Mathematics!</p>
