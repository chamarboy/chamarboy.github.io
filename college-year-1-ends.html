                <p>Loser….in every sense of the word.</p>
<p>Gunjan has left, I dont exactly know why….but I do have few ideas. I do
not have the courage to face her. If she knows that am a chamar boy,
then she has decided this, then things might be better left unsaid….this
is something I am born with, cant really change that….i have dreaded
this moment for last 3 years …. feel relived in a weird way.</p>
<p>I did decently in the first semester, the second semester was a
different story all together. A lot of things have changed. I failed an
exam, and barely passed this semester – 59% . This effectively means I
am bottom of the class, solidifying my chamar level intellect and
capabilities. I am not really concerned, there are bigger problems.</p>
<p>Home is a hellhole right now. I am dealing with some potentially legal
and ethical issues ...due to some questionable acts done by my younger
sister. As a brother, I am bound to act….these acts may be illegal, and
might really require physical confrontation…..decisive
confrontations….my sister’s honor is involved. The dilemma is how to
make sure she remains protected even if I am not there anymore….cant
involve parents, they are already drinking to their full capacity…. They
wont be able to take it. I am trying, but nothing seems to be do-able
without really killing anyone in a clean strike. Legal is not an option,
my sister would come out looking bad. Cant really discuss with
friends….or ask for help….cant share the details. I am on my own for
now.</p>
<p>Gunjan leaving me, and the manner in which she did…..leaves me with a
lot of questions….my existence, my worth and the fact that this chamar
birth is the underlying layer of my identity ….. which cannot be
changed. I cannot ignore this feeling of hollowness, and the lingering
doubt that no matter how much I try or contribute….i would be judged as
a chamar, not as a human being.</p>
<p>It is a depressing thought and I am not dealing with it correctly...but
what is the point? I cannot undo any of this. Does it mean that I need
to consider caste as the primary criteria to make friends? Should I
ignore natural attraction or should I be attracted to only caste
approved friends? How would 2 caste appropriate couple look like in
college ? Do I even know a female who is SC/ST? Would she spurn me as
she may not want to be seen as SC/ST? Or it would be a comic relief
moment like in old movies where the comedy sidekick would have a comedy
sidekick female as a mate? Am I a sidekick in my own story? Are all
SC/ST burden on society? Is reservation a right earned or is it a nice
offering by society’ nice ppl….the kind that white people felt when they
encountered tribal/natives in their imperial conquests? Do I really have
friends ? Would they react similarly?</p>
<p>I have lots of questions.</p>
<p>Maybe she left me because I suck….generally as a person….too tight
lipped, no fun….and have no ability to afford fun. Gunjan gets Rs50 a
day, and I get Rs 20 a week. She needs to live life at its
fullest...maybe I was becoming a roadblock in this….my being generally
negative and jealous of most guys she interacts….i know all of them are
bastards….but hot girls do prioritize feeling of jealousy rather than
analyzing the behavior in a cerebral way.</p>
<p>I have succeeded in inheriting a scooter from my father, but I do not
want her to be seen on it….it is way below her standards...and I am not
sure if I am the right choice for her….so better is to be alone….and
stay away...self preserve….whatever is left….and maybe some day….. The
thing I am absolutely sure of that she is better off without
me….tainting her with chamar touch is the last thing I want to do.
Gunjan, before formally telling me to stay away….also made clear that we
were never in a relationship….i can only imagine how disappointing she
must be feeling in me.</p>
<p>Maybe it never happened...maybe it is all in my head….and maybe this all
is true. I try not to think of this.</p>
<p>I am starting to like cigarettes. They dont ask any questions, dont
judge you, loyal to the core for the ones who are just checked out of
life….blaming cigarettes and not the world or their inability to deal
with it. 5 minutes of pure bliss….mind blanks out….numbness for 5
minutes….that is all I can afford right now. Not worried about
cancer….it would be a blessing in disguise right now….a perfect alibi
for my failures.</p>
<p>At college….i do get a breather. Friends do know about the breakup….they
are sympathetic...and help me with studies. The only thing which I seem
to have gained is Anusha and Ashish….both of them seem to have accepted
me despite my chamar-ness.</p>
<p>Anusha is a popular girl in college. She talks to me mostly, happy and
optimistic….somethings which do give me hope..that these circumstances
are my and my burden alone...life can be fair and enjoyable.</p>
<p>It is not all bad, my account seems like a lot of self pity. There are
some things which have my attention…... I got my computer – aVintron P3
with 16MB RAM, 4 GB of HDD. That poor thing is facing the brunt of my
attention. It took some convincing with my father to make him shell out
45k for this latest computer. RAM was bit on low side, but I am making
it work.</p>
<p>In college, we still use the age old Turbo C, an outdated IDE which
works on DOS or windows. Most my my college mates still use it. For me
it is too old. I had computers as an elective in my school, where I
consistently topped my class without any efforts. I seem to have a knack
for computers, so I decided to kick it up a notch….try the most exciting
thing happening in computer science – LINUX.</p>
<p>CDs – which came along with computer magazine were the primary medium of
getting latest software, or there was grey market for pirated software.
I have become friends with some of competitors at local video game
parlor. Taking up computers as major in college seems like a golden
ticket to all Indian middle class, hence some of these friends had the
luxury of computer magazine subs. They are kind enough to let me borrow
them. This months CD was RED HAT linux 6.2, which no one could make
sense out of. I have the complete ownership of it. So here I was….with
an exam tomo, and computer with this thing called LINUX in front of me.
Time flew – I did not give up even after rendering the computer
unusable. There is no internet – only man pages to make sense out of
this so called GUI installer. I soaked it all in...it made a whole lot
of sense to me. I failed in that exam, but it felt like a good bargain.
This has become a sole obsession for me now, whenever I font have money
(almost everyday) I spend this time breaking my head with Linux and
making sense of it. I am fascinated by the intellect of these people,
their generosity, and their confidence of putting your work out there. I
can endlessly write about Open Source and how it is the greatest feat
achieved my mankind so far. It outweighs industrial revolution, bulbs,
electricity by a long shot in my opinion. All those inventions were a
result of greed, profit or just grandiose….this was something
different….people working for a cause...with no incentive….trying to
change the world with little hope and pure merit….and they were steady
and unapologetic. And here I was, still fighting some obsolete human
construct without any rhyme or logic. In a way, this philosophy appealed
to me deeply, more than anything else in the world.</p>
<p>I am seeking people – teachers or students with similar outlook, but I
am hoping for too much. College or the incompetent, Chamar loathing
teachers which this college hired are the biggest reason of me giving up
on academics.</p>
<p>My bitterness with this college has followed a linear graph. From a
proud and optimistic student on day 1, when I was on top of the world,
to this dismissive, pessimistic hollow creature...the decline has been
phenomenal. This instance which happened in this semester broke my last
belief of intellectual parity in this world.</p>
<p>In one of the tests we were given the following problem</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: Write a function to find number vowels in a string. (5 Marks)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My solution was on the lines of something similar as below:</p>
<p>int count_vowels(char input[])</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>int num_vowels=0;</p>
<p>char character;</p>
<p>for (int i=0; i&lt;strlen(input), i++)</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>//convert to lowercase</p>
<p>if ( input[i] &gt;= A)</p>
<p>character = input[i] – 32;</p>
<p>else</p>
<p>character = input[i];</p>
<p>switch(character):</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>case ‘e’:</p>
<p>case ‘i’:</p>
<p>case ‘o’:</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>num_vowels++;</p>
<p>break;</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>return num_vowels;</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>I was sure of getting 30/30. Most of the my peers did get 30/30. I got
25/30. I went to our pretty teacher. I waited for the initial excitement
to settle, then went to her with the answer book, with this solution
open.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mam, this is correct, but marked as wrong.</p>
<p>Why are you not using multiple breaks? And what is this weird if else
thing in the loop.</p>
<p>This is to handle uppercase letters.</p>
<p>Ok, why is not every case statement followed by break?</p>
<p>Mam, it is a shortcut to optimize………………..</p>
<p>How many shortcuts in life would you take?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was not sure what she meant...or I was not sure if it was intended in
the way I perceived it. I looked up to make sure. She was slightly
smiling, with undeniable hint of superiority ….the same which expression
rich people have when they deny a request from a helpless being….dog or
beggar.</p>
<p>I paused, then without saying a word, I went back to my desk. I was in
denial for few days….coming to terms with a hard reality is
difficult…..given I had wonderful teachers in my school. A core
biological value of being treated fairly was in question. When the
denial progressed to acceptance, my my transformation was complete.</p>
<p>I have taken this as a kind of challenge….I wont give a fuck and still
pass...lets see how bad it can get?</p>
<p>And it has gotten really bad. Bad to the extent that despite being the
best coder in this batch, I would never get the marks to reflect that.
Like a typical bullheaded uncaring asshole that I am, I have to raise
this very prove-able reoccurring issue, I would take whatever marks were
granted with a smile. People were given perfect 100 in labs, and I would
get 70,80 but never above that. These are the lowest marks awarded in
these lab evaluations.</p>
<p>I am not budging. As my tenure in this college progresses, this typical
Punjabi overconfident cunt of a teacher would not leave a single
opportunity to deny me a fair evaluation and other teachers included lab
assistants have joined in.</p>
