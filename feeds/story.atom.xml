&lt;h2&gt;&lt;em&gt;You people have nothing to worry about, you'll get jobs easily. The problem is for people like us&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ankur quipped while we are discussing the prospects of getting job after college. Being a back bencher and flunking in numerous examinations, I do not know how to respond to this unexpected attack. We are bunking some class, sitting outside a food joint. I am holding Anusha's hand, she might have felt my hand twitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a long silence, considering the path of least resistance, i decided to change the topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The job market is difficult after the recession. All of us have some hard time ahead of us&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the Jack ma look alike had to make make his point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why do you why people like you would look into the private job market? There's so many of amazing opportunities available in the government sector. And believe me, you will earn far more than the private sector&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It's not for everyone to see things your way.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that ended the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked at Anusha as she is looking into my eyes. She is asking me to ignore this, but I cant seem to decide. We decide to go back to college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were happy gang of 15 middle class misfits, who who liked each other some of them had romantic inclinations. Some things have changed. Now we are 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anusha is like a friend I never deserved or worked for. Of all the people in my life, I think she is the only one who feels what I am going through. I have never shared details of the legal and moral issues I am facing at home, but she only knows about Gunjan, and how I am still deeply in love with a with her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel i am selfishly using her. I have no prospects, a loser to the core, still she prefers me. Even I dont prefer myself these days. She still does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gunjan....I dont know if she will be back or she has gone for good. I cant stop thinking about her. Maybe she is dating a stud she deserves...maybe she is being tricked by one of the thousand bastards who seem to be following her day and night. Anyways, I dont seem to deserve her. She has a good idea or some good info on me being an undeserving chamar who tricked her into accepting my proposal.....good that nothing happened....this guilt of tricking her would have killed me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is Anusha, the best of girls I would ever meet....holding my hand despite knowing my reality. I can feel love when she holds my hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I don't know how it happened. I don't even remember the first time I held her hand, it seemed to have happened naturally.
As far as i can remember, she was talking me about a guy she seemed to have been dating, and it did not end well...i understood....and maybe that is how we became friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the things between us seemed to be unsaid. She will wait for me, I would wait for her....find any simple excuse to be with her.....go on long walks....bunk classes to be with her. She did not seem to mind sitting on my old scooter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She somehow understood....and I could feel her....her hands told me all i needed to know....some weird telepathy shit....or i am delusional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know what hurts her, I know when I hurt her, and how could I make it alright. She never hurt me.....and when she did....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come back to the present moment...
This awkward argument means Jack Maa is targeting me now, after  kicking Ashish out of the initial group of 15. Everyone in this leftover group of 7 is a bloody beta, all ugly or short....basically un dateable set of severely undeserving poor specimen of the male form. No one Anusha would ever consider.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Story"></category><category term="College"></category><category term="Caste"></category><category term="India"></category><category term="Delhi"></category><category term="Engineering"></category><category term="Friends"></category><category term="Gunjan"></category><category term="JackMaa"></category></entry><entry><title>2003 - the year that changed everything</title><link href="https://chamarboy.com/2003-the-year-that-changed-everything.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-09-26T22:57:00+05:30</published><updated>2021-03-07T00:49:34+05:30</updated><author><name>Chamar Boy</name></author><id>tag:chamarboy.com,2020-09-26:/2003-the-year-that-changed-everything.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;26 Sept 2003&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think i passed engineering. Not happy but relieved.
 I am oscillating between a deep sense of regret of not doing the things I wanted to do in engineering and the relief that I survived despite all odds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the first batch of engineering from this college, there are not many prospects to start with. Though I am trying for jobs, my heart knows that i will not get any - grades and the way I looked - deformed bald and itchy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am trying to prepare for GATE, to finally do the nerdy stuff which i am very capable of doing. 4 years of engineering taught me a valuable lesson - people are highly ordinary - not capable of creating anything new, just masters of mugging and following the orders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The legal storm caused by my sisters adventures finally seems to be over, my father seems to have it handled. I never disclosed it to anyone, but I am prepared to do &lt;strong&gt;anything&lt;/strong&gt; if the situation goes worse. Every night I  evaluate the strategy, the tools and the things I need to be careful about. This decision is a combined result of my current state, my duties as a brother and my complete belief that life would not be any different from what I have experienced it till now. Life in prison sounded way real and acceptable than spending years with the scared yet competitive sheep of engineering college graduates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mom and father love each other. I cant make sense of it. My father is a principled, hard working individual, though my mother is really nothing but manipulative, power hungry, ugly excuse of a female. It is not like only I hated her, all of us did, except my father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least once a month, my mother and father would take off to a &lt;em&gt;date&lt;/em&gt; of sorts - they would leave in morning and come back late at night. This has been one of the happiest days of the month for me and my sisters for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Off late, I have distanced myself from my second sister. I like being alone and destructive, a man who has no one and nothing to loose. The people around me are too busy to cater to their plans to take over the world, who would care about a discolored, bottom of the class chamar boy? Hey, my answer is the same as you, hence the going out in brotherly glory plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am happy at the prospect of never going back to the college again, forced to communicate with those judgmental pricks of classmates, teachers who would congratulate me and suggest that i would get a fat &lt;em&gt;sarkari&lt;/em&gt; job now. Somehow Infy, TCS, Polaris etc are never discussed with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mom and Dad left for their monthly date, sister is out doing whatever she does. I am up, go to the computer room and dial up the Internet. Checking mail, yeah....no prospects, the self destruct plan stands. Phone rings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hate phone....she never calls, and she wont. She knows now, atleast suspects it...me being a chamaar. How can the shiniest, most popular girl date a chamar? Anyways, I will explain the situation later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I answer, the digits seem similar - the call is from our family cell phone. I pick up, though i do not recognize the voice. The voice is of my uncle, he is trying to tell me something important in a very non important way. The car has broken down, and i need to come to get it fixed. I should get a friend to drive my bike back so I could drive the car after getting it repaired. The location is near a hospital. I say yes, and did not argue how illogical the plan sounded. In the background i could hear a lot of commotion. Anyways, i needed to patch up my appearance and drive a bike with no rear brakes for 100 kms. When you are on a death wish, these choices are really not a choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I call up a friend, a fellow SC/ST boy who flunked and now is a junior. Caste seems to be the only quality which defines my life right now. I am afraid of the general friends - ex girl friend might have blabbered..the news might have spread....and i have lost my looks. Most of people avoid me in college, the friends i thought i had left me because a girl who seems to have loved me, told everyone that i molested her. I never did. I literally and figuratively had lost my face and most friends with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SC friend shows up. He is riding pillion and i am driving my Bajaj caliber chroma. My friend is asking a lot of questions, i dont have any answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I drive, having some non-sense chatter with friend. My mind is racing though. Maybe my grandmother is sick or died and maybe my dad is too broken up to drive. This seemed to be the most logical interpretations of the facts i could recall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After an hours drive, we arrive at a hospital. As i enter, I could see 100s of faces I had forgotten. They seemed to be all watching me closely. I am not sure if its due to my current appearance or due to the incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something is amiss. The damm car seems fine. People are crying, I am trying to find someone talk-able. Someone directs me to a sub group. Mother is crying, trying to be sad than she is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Father is dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How, why and what the fuck? Did her stupidity killed him or was it an assault? I am enraged, hoping it was an assault....and i get to kill someone for it...finally justify my existence. It was a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dont understand...are they sure? This is a good private hospital...they must be sure. I could have reacted way more naturally had I was not surrounded by literally 100s of people. Indians love drama, and i was customary bound to provide it today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something has hardened me enough to disobey conventions, and to realize what it means.....I am no longer the kid brother, or someone who can ask for help. With my stupid mom and uncontrollable sister.....what the literal fuck?? I need help to come to terms of what is happening to me and now this added responsibility too?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing is fair. As my brain is processing the implications, I am interrupted - there are choices to be made. Where to do the &lt;em&gt;kriyas&lt;/em&gt;? I dont know. I am thinking here. I have my uncles, and I do not know what is to be done. My mother interferes. She turns off her crying for a moment and tells me to tell them Rohini, at our new home. I want to protest, but then a dollop of emotional superiority infused cold logic shrewd logic is disclosed....we need to keep up the reputation. I just want to be alone, as soon as possible. I say yes. Handing over the keys of the bike to the friend i tell him to be careful, the rear brakes are not working, the front ones do, but they are more effective than one anticipates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though centuries have passed, the discrimination remains solid as ever.
Most people generally assume that people belonging to this category of caste have an easy, express path to professional success and prosperity, A notion which i aim to challenge and provide a real life view.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anusha, of all the females i have known in my life, you were the most kind, affectionate, intelligent and million other good things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You were flawless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really wanted to be good for you....for the fact that i could not imagine not having your voice in my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you had given hundreds of hours of me whining about my ex girlfriend Gunjan, I wanted to be sure.
For me, you were pure....an angel....maybe a god.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really wanted to be sure, when i commit to you I commit for good, not as a insecure rebound from Gunjan.......you were the nicest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that time never arrived, and i was sure that it may never. I have not ever really gotten over Gunjan...and i really knew that you have bigger things in store for you....to me it seemed like you chose to score low....your potential was infinite....and I am a chamar boy ....getting Rs 20 a week, who just wanted to die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it got worse....skin gave away....and so did my belief of me being destined for self destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did misbehave with you and probably cheated you emotionally.....but you have to understand....you were the only good in my life back then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never really blamed for what happened next...i knew i deserved it....but i would have heard it from you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may be possible yet improbable that you might carry some guilt of what happened. Hope this helps....i deserved it and i am sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still miss you....for you are the only person who may still understand me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, you are still the only person who is truly broken me.....it feels like you still have a part of me, and i still have yours. I still feel you...i still understand your emotions your hands your breath and those thousand different emotions your beautiful eyes conveyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still imagine me exhaling on you soft skin and feeling your scent.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Story"></category><category term="Anusha"></category><category term="College"></category><category term="Now"></category><category term="Missing you"></category><category term="India"></category></entry><entry><title>Introduction</title><link href="https://chamarboy.com/introduction.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-09-01T22:57:00+05:30</published><updated>2021-03-07T06:11:16+05:30</updated><author><name>Chamar Boy</name></author><id>tag:chamarboy.com,2020-09-01:/introduction.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Who&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a Chamar boy, born in a somewhat normal middle class (not Chamar
middle class, normal middle class) family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was born in 1981 in a semi-urban village in Delhi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My father had a Bajaj Super in 1990, and we got a landline telephone in
1997.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Who&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a Chamar boy, born in a somewhat normal middle class (not Chamar
middle class, normal middle class) family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was born in 1981 in a semi-urban village in Delhi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My father had a Bajaj Super in 1990, and we got a landline telephone in
1997.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know it\'s hard to imagine a village in Delhi now, but in 1990 till
the time we stayed there, it had a water well, we had cows and cow dung
was the primary fuel though my father got us LPG ever since i can
remember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now here we are. Year is 2020, the most chaotic year for my
generation, but somehow I am better placed than I ever was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a spacious (in most senses) house, 2 cars, 2 dogs, a beautiful
and intelligent son and mostly loving wife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I work at Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is the big reveal. 2 Cr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That declaration is not an achievement, I just want my readers to know
what they are dealing with here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Facebook and the money thing seems important to society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently it kind of justifies my existence. People are nicer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hypocrisy of society becomes very apparent when you are even minutely
successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since I have realized what Chamar is, and how apparently we have
special powers given by the constitution, a subject of envy and
inflammatory debates on social media and hushed discussion in social
circles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Why&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I am getting older, I do tend to think about the past, mostly to
learn from it. I remember those days, when my self worth was negative
million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was targeted, gaslit at college, did not take it well, slipped in a
depression, developed Psoriasis, spent years in a sham ayurvedic ashram
with skin swollen like a balloon filled with pus covered in cow dung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abandonment by the girl I loved, the girl who loved me, friends, my own
family. A failed suicide attempt, living through vengeance, death of
father, a sister which destroyed the family, destroyed my existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All because I am a Chamar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was not all bad, It somehow made me realize the strengths which I
thought I never had, and did generally well. Something kept me pushing,
and I kept breathing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to share my journey with you. Anyone who feels like I did in my
Chamar years can get some semblance of hope or direction and hopefully
he/she does not commit the grave mistakes I did, or felt like how I
felt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;To Readers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you get a balanced view of a Chamar life and hopefully next time
you feel like feeling taller, maybe you will be empathetic to the SC/ST
humanoid in your class, office or school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you feel like saying stuff, you have the full freedom to give me a
piece of your mind, absolutely brutally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have will update the blog in a way that anonymous are welcome and give
me their best shot. It\'s sort of a fuel to me now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;To my fellow Chamaar/SC/ST Readers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you feel hopeful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you can believe in yourself, rather than what society is telling
you silently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If my journey can benefit any one of you, my efforts would make sense to
me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;How&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will try to narrate it in a novel kind of style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You already know where I am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Logically my story starts in class 11, when I started realizing the
implications of being a chamar, what it meant for career, for making
friends, girls and neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have changed certain key details, to preserve the identity of the
people involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will narrate the journey, leaving the judgment to readers.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Story"></category><category term="Introduction"></category><category term="Why"></category><category term="What"></category><category term="Casteism"></category><category term="India"></category></entry></feed>
