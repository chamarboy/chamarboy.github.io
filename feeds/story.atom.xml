&lt;p&gt;You people have nothing to worry about, you&amp;#8217;ll get jobs easily. The

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ankur quipped while we are discussing the prospects of getting job after&amp;nbsp;college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;W&lt;/em&gt;e are discussing the prospects of getting job after college. The
uncertainty caused by past &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IT&lt;/span&gt; recessions trigger this. Weather is
pleasant. We are sitting outside a &lt;em&gt;Nirulas’&lt;/em&gt; under picnic umbrellas.
This is part of a laid back market complex which does not do much
business. It is walking distance from college, we love to take a long
walk from college to&amp;nbsp;here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ashish has been kicked out from the group, and some friends choose to
stay with him. I wanted to, but I choose to stay where Anusha seems to
be comfortable. This has reduced the number from around 15 to 5. We are
bunking some class, sitting outside a food joint. I am holding Anusha&amp;#8217;s
hand, she might have felt my hand&amp;nbsp;twitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a perennial back bencher and flunking in numerous examinations
(total 5 papers till now), I do not know how to respond to this
unexpected attack. Being a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SC&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ST&lt;/span&gt; student, it has become apparent to me
that I cannot be just lazy, average or not interested, I am just an
incompetent loser who does not deserve to sit between these enlightened
beings. They seem to be doing me a favor by caring to listen to&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a long silence, considering the path of least resistance, i
decided to change the&amp;nbsp;topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The job market is difficult after the recession. All of us have some
hard time ahead of&amp;nbsp;us&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the Jack Maa look alike had to make make his&amp;nbsp;point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do you why people like you would look into the private job market?
There&amp;#8217;s so many of amazing opportunities available in the government
sector. And believe me, you will earn far more than the private&amp;nbsp;sector&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, somebody say&amp;nbsp;something…&amp;#8230;silence!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not for everyone to see things your&amp;nbsp;way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that ended the&amp;nbsp;discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, the crucial part of this open discrimination practiced by teachers,
students and even chaprasis of this great institute – &lt;em&gt;Bharati
Vidyapeeth&lt;/em&gt;, Delhi and the even greater dumb-ass university it
represents – Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University, was allocating
the roll numbers – I think first 6 roll numbers represent the reserved
community – &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SC&lt;/span&gt;/STs or &lt;em&gt;chuda/chamar&lt;/em&gt; as thought of by the these
enlightened and entitled middle class&amp;nbsp;chutias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked at Anusha as she is looking into my eyes. She is asking me to
ignore this, but I cant seem to decide. We decide to go back to college.
She has been one of those rare humans who has offered me parity – of
thought, ability….respect of being treated like another human&amp;nbsp;being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were happy gang of 15 middle class misfits, who who liked each other
some of them had romantic inclinations. Some things have changed. Now we
are 5/7 people (2 of them cant seem to&amp;nbsp;decide).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anusha is like a friend I never deserved or worked for. Of all the
people in my life, I think she is the only one who feels what I am going
through. I have never shared details of the legal and moral issues I am
facing at home, but she only knows about Gunjan, and how I am still
deeply in love with a with&amp;nbsp;her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel i am selfishly using her. I have no prospects, a loser to the
core, still she prefers me. Even I don&amp;#8217;t prefer myself these days. She
still&amp;nbsp;does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gunjan&amp;#8230;.I don&amp;#8217;t know if she will be back or she has gone for good. I
cant stop thinking about her. Maybe she is dating a stud she
deserves&amp;#8230;maybe she is being tricked by one of the thousand bastards
who seem to be following her day and night. Anyways, I don&amp;#8217;t seem to
deserve her. She has a good idea or some suspicion of me being an
undeserving chamar who tricked her into accepting my proposal&amp;#8230;..good
that nothing happened&amp;#8230;.this guilt of tricking her would have killed&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is Anusha, the best of girls I would ever meet&amp;#8230;.holding my hand
despite knowing my reality. I can feel love when she holds my&amp;nbsp;hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I don&amp;#8217;t know how it happened. I don&amp;#8217;t even remember the first time I
held her hand, it seemed to have happened&amp;nbsp;spontaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as i can remember, she was talking me about a guy she seemed to
have been dating, and it did not end well&amp;#8230;i understood&amp;#8230;.and maybe
that is how we became&amp;nbsp;friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the things between us seemed to be unsaid. She will wait for me,
I would wait for her&amp;#8230;.find any simple excuse to be with her&amp;#8230;..go on
long walks&amp;#8230;.bunk classes to be with her. She did not seem to mind
sitting on my old&amp;nbsp;scooter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She somehow understood&amp;#8230;.and I could feel her&amp;#8230;.her hands told me all
i needed to know&amp;#8230;.some weird telepathy shit&amp;#8230;.or i am&amp;nbsp;delusional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know what hurts her, I know when I hurt her, and how could I make it
alright. She never hurt me&amp;#8230;..and when she did&amp;#8230;.it was&amp;nbsp;brutal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming back to the present moment,This awkward argument means Jack Maa
is targeting me now. After kicking Ashish and his loyalists out,
everyone in this leftover group of 7 is a bloody beta, all ugly, short
or severely limited in intellect&amp;#8230;.basically an un-date-able set of
severely undeserving poor specimen of the male form. No one Anusha or
any conscious female or any functional girl would ever&amp;nbsp;consider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or am I about to be proved&amp;nbsp;wrong???&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the uninitiated, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chamar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is one of the sub castes, which also
comes under rather lager or politically correct term &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dalit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though centuries have passed, the discrimination remains prevalent as&amp;nbsp;ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people generally assume that people belonging to this category of
caste have an easy, express path to professional success and prosperity,
A notion which i aim to challenge and provide a real life&amp;nbsp;view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anusha, of all the females i have known in my life, you were the most
kind, affectionate, intelligent and million other good&amp;nbsp;things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You were&amp;nbsp;flawless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really wanted to be good for you&amp;#8230;.for the fact that i could not
imagine not having your voice in my&amp;nbsp;life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you had given hundreds of hours of me whining about my ex girlfriend
Gunjan, I wanted to be&amp;nbsp;sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, you were pure&amp;#8230;.an angel&amp;#8230;.maybe a&amp;nbsp;god.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really wanted to be sure, when i commit to you I commit for good, not
as a insecure rebound from Gunjan&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230;.you were the&amp;nbsp;nicest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that time never arrived, and i was sure that it may never. I have
not ever really gotten over Gunjan&amp;#8230;and i really knew that you have
bigger things in store for you&amp;#8230;.to me it seemed like you chose to
score low&amp;#8230;.your potential was infinite&amp;#8230;.and I am a chamar boy
&amp;#8230;.getting Rs 20 a week, who just wanted to&amp;nbsp;die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it got worse&amp;#8230;.skin gave away&amp;#8230;.and so did my belief of me being
destined for self&amp;nbsp;destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did misbehave with you and probably cheated you emotionally&amp;#8230;..but
you have to understand&amp;#8230;.you were the only good in my life back&amp;nbsp;then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never really blamed for what happened next&amp;#8230;i knew i deserved
it&amp;#8230;.but i would have heard it from&amp;nbsp;you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may be possible yet improbable that you might carry some guilt of
what happened. Hope this helps&amp;#8230;.i deserved it and i am&amp;nbsp;sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still miss you&amp;#8230;.for you are the only person who may still understand&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, you are still the only person who is truly broken me&amp;#8230;..it
feels like you still have a part of me, and i still have yours. I still
feel you&amp;#8230;i still understand your emotions your hands your breath and
those thousand different emotions your beautiful eyes&amp;nbsp;conveyed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a Chamar boy, born in a somewhat normal middle class (not Chamar
middle class, normal middle class)&amp;nbsp;family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was born in 1981 in a semi-urban village in&amp;nbsp;Delhi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My father had a Bajaj Super in 1990, and we got a landline telephone in&amp;nbsp;1997.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Who&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a Chamar boy, born in a somewhat normal middle class (not Chamar
middle class, normal middle class)&amp;nbsp;family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was born in 1981 in a semi-urban village in&amp;nbsp;Delhi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My father had a Bajaj Super in 1990, and we got a landline telephone in&amp;nbsp;1997.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know it&amp;#8217;s hard to imagine a village in Delhi now, but in 1990 till the
time we stayed there, it had a water well, we had cows and cow dung was
the primary fuel though my father got us &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LPG&lt;/span&gt; ever since i can&amp;nbsp;remember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now here we are. Year is 2020, the most chaotic year for my
generation, but somehow I am better placed than I ever&amp;nbsp;was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a spacious (in most senses) house, 2 cars, 2 dogs, a beautiful
and intelligent son and mostly loving&amp;nbsp;wife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I work at&amp;nbsp;Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is the big reveal. 2&amp;nbsp;Cr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That declaration is not an achievement, I just want my readers to know
what they are dealing with&amp;nbsp;here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Facebook and the money thing seems important to&amp;nbsp;society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently it kind of justifies my existence. People are&amp;nbsp;nicer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hypocrisy of society becomes very apparent when you are even minutely&amp;nbsp;successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since I have realized what Chamar is, and how apparently we have
special powers given by the constitution, a subject of envy and
inflammatory debates on social media and hushed discussion in social&amp;nbsp;circles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Why&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I am getting older, I do tend to think about the past, mostly to
learn from it. I remember those days, when my self worth was negative&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was targeted, gaslit at college, did not take it well, slipped in a
depression, developed Psoriasis, spent years in a sham ayurvedic ashram
with skin swollen like a balloon filled with pus covered in cow&amp;nbsp;dung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abandonment by the girl I loved, the girl who loved me, friends, my own
family. A failed suicide attempt, living through vengeance, death of
father, a sister which destroyed the family, destroyed my&amp;nbsp;existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All because I am a&amp;nbsp;Chamar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was not all bad, It somehow made me realize the strengths which I
thought I never had, and did generally well. Something kept me pushing,
and I kept&amp;nbsp;breathing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to share my journey with you. Anyone who feels like I did in my
Chamar years can get some semblance of hope or direction and hopefully
he/she does not commit the grave mistakes I did, or felt like how I&amp;nbsp;felt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;To&amp;nbsp;Readers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you get a balanced view of a Chamar life and hopefully next time
you feel like feeling taller, maybe you will be empathetic to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SC&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ST&lt;/span&gt;
humanoid in your class, office or&amp;nbsp;school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you feel like saying stuff, you have the full freedom to give me a
piece of your mind, absolutely&amp;nbsp;brutally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have will update the blog in a way that anonymous are welcome and give
me their best shot. It&amp;#8217;s sort of a fuel to me&amp;nbsp;now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;To my fellow Chamaar/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SC&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ST&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Readers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you&amp;nbsp;learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you feel&amp;nbsp;hopeful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you can believe in yourself, rather than what society is telling
you&amp;nbsp;silently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If my journey can benefit any one of you, my efforts would make sense to&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;How&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will try to narrate it in a novel kind of&amp;nbsp;style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You already know where I&amp;nbsp;am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Logically my story starts in class 11, when I started realizing the
implications of being a chamar, what it meant for career, for making
friends, girls and&amp;nbsp;neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have changed certain key details, to preserve the identity of the
people&amp;nbsp;involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will narrate the journey, leaving the judgment to&amp;nbsp;readers.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Story"></category><category term="Introduction"></category><category term="Why"></category><category term="What"></category><category term="Casteism"></category><category term="India"></category></entry></feed>
