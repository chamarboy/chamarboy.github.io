&lt;p&gt;I am a Chamar boy, born in a somewhat normal middle class (not Chamar
middle class, normal middle class) family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was born in 1981 in a semi-urban village in Delhi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My father had a Bajaj Super in 1990, and we got a landline telephone in
1997.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know â€¦&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Who&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a Chamar boy, born in a somewhat normal middle class (not Chamar
middle class, normal middle class) family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was born in 1981 in a semi-urban village in Delhi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My father had a Bajaj Super in 1990, and we got a landline telephone in
1997.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know it's hard to imagine a village in Delhi now, but in 1990 till the
time we stayed there, it had a water well, we had cows and cow dung was
the primary fuel though my father got us LPG ever since i can remember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now here we are. Year is 2020, the most chaotic year for my
generation, but somehow I am better placed than I ever was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a spacious (in most senses) house, 2 cars, 2 dogs, a beautiful
and intelligent son and mostly loving wife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I work at Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is the big reveal. 2 Cr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That declaration is not an achievement, I just want my readers to know
what they are dealing with here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Facebook and the money thing seems important to society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently it kind of justifies my existence. People are nicer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hypocrisy of society becomes very apparent when you are even minutely
successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since I have realized what Chamar is, and how apparently we have
special powers given by the constitution, a subject of envy and
inflammatory debates on social media and hushed discussion in social
circles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Why&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I am getting older, I do tend to think about the past, mostly to
learn from it. I remember those days, when my self worth was negative
million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was targeted, gaslit at college, did not take it well, slipped in a
depression, developed Psoriasis, spent years in a sham ayurvedic ashram
with skin swollen like a balloon filled with pus covered in cow dung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abandonment by the girl I loved, the girl who loved me, friends, my own
family. A failed suicide attempt, living through vengeance, death of
father, a sister which destroyed the family, destroyed my existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All because I am a Chamar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was not all bad, It somehow made me realize the strengths which I
thought I never had, and did generally well. Something kept me pushing,
and I kept breathing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to share my journey with you. Anyone who feels like I did in my
Chamar years can get some semblance of hope or direction and hopefully
he/she does not commit the grave mistakes I did, or felt like how I
felt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;To Readers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you get a balanced view of a Chamar life and hopefully next time
you feel like feeling taller, maybe you will be empathetic to the SC/ST
humanoid in your class, office or school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you feel like saying stuff, you have the full freedom to give me a
piece of your mind, absolutely brutally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have will update the blog in a way that anonymous are welcome and give
me their best shot. It's sort of a fuel to me now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;To my fellow Chamaar/SC/ST Readers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you feel hopeful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you can believe in yourself, rather than what society is telling
you silently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If my journey can benefit any one of you, my efforts would make sense to
me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;How&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will try to narrate it in a novel kind of style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You already know where I am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Logically my story starts in class 11, when I started realizing the
implications of being a chamar, what it meant for career, for making
friends, girls and neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have changed certain key details, to preserve the identity of the
people involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will narrate the journey, leaving the judgment to readers.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Story"></category><category term="Introduction"></category><category term="Why"></category><category term="What"></category><category term="Casteism"></category><category term="India"></category></entry></feed>
