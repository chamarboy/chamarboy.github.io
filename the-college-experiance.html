                <blockquote>
<p>You people have nothing to worry about, you&#8217;ll get jobs easily. The
problem is for people like&nbsp;us</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ankur quipped while we are discussing the prospects of getting job after&nbsp;college.</p>
<p><em>W</em>e are discussing the prospects of getting job after college. The
uncertainty caused by past <span class="caps">IT</span> recessions trigger this. Weather is
pleasant. We are sitting outside a <em>Nirulas’</em> under picnic umbrellas.
This is part of a laid back market complex which does not do much
business. It is walking distance from college, we love to take a long
walk from college to&nbsp;here.</p>
<p>Ashish has been kicked out from the group, and some friends choose to
stay with him. I wanted to, but I choose to stay where Anusha seems to
be comfortable. This has reduced the number from around 15 to 5. We are
bunking some class, sitting outside a food joint. I am holding Anusha&#8217;s
hand, she might have felt my hand&nbsp;twitch.</p>
<p>Being a perennial back bencher and flunking in numerous examinations
(total 5 papers till now), I do not know how to respond to this
unexpected attack. Being a <span class="caps">SC</span>/<span class="caps">ST</span> student, it has become apparent to me
that I cannot be just lazy, average or not interested, I am just an
incompetent loser who does not deserve to sit between these enlightened
beings. They seem to be doing me a favor by caring to listen to&nbsp;me.</p>
<p>After a long silence, considering the path of least resistance, i
decided to change the&nbsp;topic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The job market is difficult after the recession. All of us have some
hard time ahead of&nbsp;us</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the Jack Maa look alike had to make make his&nbsp;point.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why do you why people like you would look into the private job market?
There&#8217;s so many of amazing opportunities available in the government
sector. And believe me, you will earn far more than the private&nbsp;sector</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh, somebody say&nbsp;something…&#8230;silence!!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s not for everyone to see things your&nbsp;way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think that ended the&nbsp;discussion.</p>
<p>Oh, the crucial part of this open discrimination practiced by teachers,
students and even chaprasis of this great institute – <em>Bharati
Vidyapeeth</em>, Delhi and the even greater dumb-ass university it
represents – Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University, was allocating
the roll numbers – I think first 6 roll numbers represent the reserved
community – <span class="caps">SC</span>/STs or <em>chuda/chamar</em> as thought of by the these
enlightened and entitled middle class&nbsp;chutias.</p>
<p>I looked at Anusha as she is looking into my eyes. She is asking me to
ignore this, but I cant seem to decide. We decide to go back to college.
She has been one of those rare humans who has offered me parity – of
thought, ability….respect of being treated like another human&nbsp;being.</p>
<p>We were happy gang of 15 middle class misfits, who who liked each other
some of them had romantic inclinations. Some things have changed. Now we
are 5/7 people (2 of them cant seem to&nbsp;decide).</p>
<p>Anusha is like a friend I never deserved or worked for. Of all the
people in my life, I think she is the only one who feels what I am going
through. I have never shared details of the legal and moral issues I am
facing at home, but she only knows about Gunjan, and how I am still
deeply in love with a with&nbsp;her.</p>
<p>I feel i am selfishly using her. I have no prospects, a loser to the
core, still she prefers me. Even I don&#8217;t prefer myself these days. She
still&nbsp;does.</p>
<p>Gunjan&#8230;.I don&#8217;t know if she will be back or she has gone for good. I
cant stop thinking about her. Maybe she is dating a stud she
deserves&#8230;maybe she is being tricked by one of the thousand bastards
who seem to be following her day and night. Anyways, I don&#8217;t seem to
deserve her. She has a good idea or some suspicion of me being an
undeserving chamar who tricked her into accepting my proposal&#8230;..good
that nothing happened&#8230;.this guilt of tricking her would have killed&nbsp;me.</p>
<p>Here is Anusha, the best of girls I would ever meet&#8230;.holding my hand
despite knowing my reality. I can feel love when she holds my&nbsp;hand.</p>
<p>And I don&#8217;t know how it happened. I don&#8217;t even remember the first time I
held her hand, it seemed to have happened&nbsp;spontaneously.</p>
<p>As far as i can remember, she was talking me about a guy she seemed to
have been dating, and it did not end well&#8230;i understood&#8230;.and maybe
that is how we became&nbsp;friends.</p>
<p>Much of the things between us seemed to be unsaid. She will wait for me,
I would wait for her&#8230;.find any simple excuse to be with her&#8230;..go on
long walks&#8230;.bunk classes to be with her. She did not seem to mind
sitting on my old&nbsp;scooter.</p>
<p>She somehow understood&#8230;.and I could feel her&#8230;.her hands told me all
i needed to know&#8230;.some weird telepathy shit&#8230;.or i am&nbsp;delusional.</p>
<p>I know what hurts her, I know when I hurt her, and how could I make it
alright. She never hurt me&#8230;..and when she did&#8230;.it was&nbsp;brutal</p>
<p>Coming back to the present moment,This awkward argument means Jack Maa
is targeting me now. After kicking Ashish and his loyalists out,
everyone in this leftover group of 7 is a bloody beta, all ugly, short
or severely limited in intellect&#8230;.basically an un-date-able set of
severely undeserving poor specimen of the male form. No one Anusha or
any conscious female or any functional girl would ever&nbsp;consider.</p>

<p>Or am I about to be proved&nbsp;wrong???</p>
